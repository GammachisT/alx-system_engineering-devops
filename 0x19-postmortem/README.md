# Postmortem Report

## Spot's Spot Incident Postmortem
### Issue Summary:
- On August 16th, 2023, from 9:15 AM to 11:42 AM UTC, pet supply e-commerce platform, Spot's Spot, experienced a significant service outage that impacted approximately 65% of daily active users.

- The root cause of this incident was a cascading failure in our database infrastructure, triggered by a faulty database migration script.

### Timeline:
- **9:15 AM UTC** - monitoring system detected a sharp increase in response times and error rates across the website and mobile applications.
- **9:20 AM UTC** - quickly identified the database as the source of the problem and assembled the engineering team to investigate.
- **9:30 AM UTC** - After some initial troubleshooting, the team discovered that a recently deployed database migration script had introduced a critical bug, causing the database to become unresponsive. 
- 9:45 AM UTC - The engineering team attempted to roll back the migration, but the damage had already been done, and the database remained in a degraded state.
- **10:00 AM UTC** - Realizing that a more comprehensive solution was needed, the engineering leadership team made the decision to failover to secondary database cluster.
- **10:15 AM UTC** - The failover process began, and the team anxiously watched as the traffic was rerouted to the secondary database.
- **10:30 AM UTC** - The failover was completed, but the engineering team faced a new challenge - ensuring that the secondary database cluster was able to handle the increased load without any data integrity or performance issues.
- **10:45 AM UTC** - The team began monitoring the secondary database cluster closely, making adjustments to the query optimization and replication configurations to optimize performance.
- **11:30 AM UTC** - After a series of tweaks and adjustments, the secondary database cluster was performing well, and the engineering team began the process of verifying the full restoration of services.
- **11:42 AM UT** - Normal operations were restored, and the outage was successfully resolved. It was time to grab a well-deserved biscuit and reflect on the lessons learned.


### Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a cascading failure in the database infrastructure, triggered by a faulty database migration script. The migration script introduced a critical bug that caused the database to become unresponsive, leading to a sharp increase in response times and error rates across the website and mobile applications.

To resolve the issue, the engineering team decided to failover to the secondary database cluster. This process involved rerouting the traffic to the secondary database, which required careful monitoring and configuration adjustments to ensure that it could handle the increased load without any data integrity or performance issues.

Once the failover was complete, the team began closely monitoring the secondary database cluster, making adjustments to the query optimization and replication configurations to optimize performance. After a series of tweaks and adjustments, the secondary database cluster was able to handle the traffic without any significant issues, and normal operations were restored.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent future database-related outages, we've come up with a list of measures that would make even the most seasoned DBA proud:

1. Implement a more robust monitoring and alerting system for database infrastructure, capable of detecting and preventing issues before they escalate.
2. Conduct regular testing and simulations of the database failover process, to ensure that it works as expected and can be executed quickly and efficiently.
3. Enhance the change management process for database-related migrations and updates, including a thorough testing and rollback plan to mitigate the risk of introducing new issues.
4. Investigate the feasibility of implementing a multi-database strategy, with the ability to automatically failover between multiple database clusters in the event of an issue.
5. Provide more training for the engineering team on database troubleshooting and optimization, to ensure that they have the necessary skills to keep database infrastructure running at peak performance.
6. Improve communication and incident response procedures, so that we can quickly notify users and keep them informed during any future outages.

By implementing these measures, we're confident that we can prevent future database-related outages and keep the users as happy as a dog with a bone.
